# Disease Outbreak Analysis & Visualization 📊

## Overview
This project analyzes disease outbreak data, focusing on key insights such as total reported cases, deaths, cured patients, and demographic trends. The analysis includes interactive visualizations using **Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib**.

## Insights Explored
- 📌 **Total cases, deaths, and cured patients**
- 📌 **Patients distribution by state and age group**
- 📌 **Worst-hit age groups and highest death rates**
- 📌 **Population-based outbreak trends**
- 📌 **Financial analysis of treatment costs**

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on disease outbreaks, including:
- `Year`: Year of the outbreak
- `Case_ID`: Unique identifier for cases
- `State`: Location of the outbreak
- `Age`: Age of patients
- `Status`: Patient outcomes (Cured, Death, etc.)
- `Age_Group`: Categorized age groups
- `Population_2022`, `Population_2023`, `Population_2024`: Population estimates

## Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for static visualizations
- **Plotly** for interactive charts

## Visualizations Included
- **Bar Charts** for total cases, deaths, and cured patients
- **Pie Charts** for patient status proportions
- **Treemaps** for outbreak severity by state
- **Sunburst Charts** for death distribution in 2022

## Financial Analysis
- 💰 **Total Available Funds:** ₦500,000,000
- 🏥 **Average Treatment Cost per Patient:** ₦8,950
- 📉 **Funds Spent on Treatment in 2024:** Calculated based on patient count
- ✅ **Remaining Funds:** After treatment expenses
